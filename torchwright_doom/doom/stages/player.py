"""PLAYER stage: discrete player state → float broadcast.

Three token types emitted after EOS, before SORTED:

    PLAYER_X     Broadcasts the pre-collision x position to all positions.
    PLAYER_Y     Broadcasts the pre-collision y position to all positions.
    PLAYER_ANGLE Looks up cos(θ)/sin(θ) for the post-turn angle and
                 broadcasts them to all positions.

The host feeds the pre-collision player state as the ``player_x`` and
``player_y`` inputs.  The ``player_angle`` input at PLAYER_ANGLE is
ignored by this stage — cos/sin are computed from INPUT's post-turn
``new_angle`` broadcast so the host never does angle arithmetic.
